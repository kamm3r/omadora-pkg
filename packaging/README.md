# Packaging the Omadora runtime

Omadora ships as two noarch RPMs, built from the Omadora source tree with the specs in this directory:

- `omarchy-settings` (`packaging/rpm/omarchy-settings/omarchy-settings.spec`): everything that must exist before the runtime and before the first user: `/etc` drop-ins, the `/etc/skel` defaults, package-owned files under `/usr`, fonts, the Plymouth and SDDM themes, branding, and the passwordless-sudo helper with its expiry support and scriptlets.
- `omarchy` (`packaging/rpm/omarchy/omarchy.spec`): every command in `/usr/bin` (linked back from `/usr/share/omarchy/bin`), the install and migration scripts, themes, the Quickshell desktop, and `omadora-sync`. It requires the `omarchy-settings` built from the same commit.

Omadora's `docs/file-layout.md` maps every source path to its package and installed location. Both specs also build `-dev` variants (`--define "dev_suffix -dev"`) that provide and replace the release packages, which is what `omarchy dev pkg-test` installs.

## Versions

The version comes from `version`, with a pre-release suffix turned into RPM's tilde so it sorts before the release: `4.0.0.alpha` becomes `4.0.0~alpha`. COPR builds get the release `0.<commit count>.git<10-character sha>`, so every published commit sorts after the one before. `.copr/core.mk` writes both into the spec it packs, because COPR rebuilds the source RPM without either checkout.

## Publishing to COPR

The live project is [kammer/omadora](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kammer/omadora/) for Fedora 44 x86_64. Its two SCM package entries clone this repository, whose `.copr/core.mk` archives the [Omadora](https://github.com/kamm3r/omadora) commit pinned in `omadora-revision` and packs it with the specs here. Both package entries have GitHub push rebuilds enabled.

To publish a change, push the Omadora commit, update `omadora-revision` in `omadora-pkg` to its full hash, and push that repository. Its GitHub webhook asks COPR to rebuild both packages from the pinned source. For a manual retry, use `copr-cli build-package kammer/omadora --name omarchy-settings` and then `copr-cli build-package kammer/omadora --name omarchy`.

Adding `fedora-45-x86_64` (or `fedora-rawhide-x86_64`) later is `copr-cli edit-chroot` or the project settings page; nothing in the specs is release-specific.

## Installing from the COPR

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable kammer/omadora
sudo dnf install omarchy
```

The runtime still expects the third-party repositories `install/fedora/repos.sh` sets up (Terra, RPM Fusion, the Hyprland and Quickshell sources).

On a machine that runs Omadora from a checkout, run `omarchy dev link <checkout>` before installing the packages. The packages add a system-wide environment bootstrap (`/etc/profile.d/omarchy.sh`, `/usr/share/uwsm/env.d/10-omarchy`) that sets `OMARCHY_PATH` to `/usr/share/omarchy` unless `/etc/omarchy.conf`, which `omarchy dev link` writes, points it at a checkout; an `OMARCHY_PATH` set by hand in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.config/uwsm/env.d/` would otherwise compete with it. With the link in place the checkout stays in charge, and the packages add what a checkout cannot provide: the `/etc` drop-ins, the boot cleanup rule, and the packaged passwordless-sudo helper.

## Checking a change before pushing

```bash
# From the Omadora checkout: build and install the -dev packages from it,
# reading the specs from this repository beside it.
omarchy dev pkg-test

# From this repository: build as COPR will, a source RPM of the pinned commit,
# then binary RPMs from it. OMADORA_SOURCE saves a clone.
OMADORA_SOURCE=../omadora make -f .copr/Makefile srpm outdir=/tmp/srpm spec=packaging/rpm/omarchy/omarchy.spec
rpmbuild --rebuild --define "_topdir /tmp/rpmbuild" /tmp/srpm/*.src.rpm

# Lint; the filters list the findings that are deliberate.
rpmlint -r packaging/rpm/omadora.rpmlintrc /tmp/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/*.rpm

# The packaging regression test: builds both specs from the Omadora checkout
# (OMADORA_SOURCE, by default ../omadora) and checks their contents.
bash test/core-packaging-test.sh
```

`make srpm` archives the commit in `omadora-revision`, not the checkout's working tree, so pin a pushed commit first. For a build in a clean Fedora root like COPR's, add yourself to the `mock` group and run `mock -r fedora-44-x86_64 --rebuild /tmp/srpm/*.src.rpm`.

## Adding files

A new file under Omadora's `etc/`, `config/`, `default/`, or `bin/` is picked up by the spec's `%install` rules; if it lands somewhere `%files` does not cover, the build fails with "Installed (but unpackaged)". A file under `etc/` that another Fedora package owns belongs in the settings spec's `etc_overrides` list instead, and a command that must exist before the runtime (or runs as root unattended) belongs in `settings_commands` in both specs.
